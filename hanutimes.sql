The record was announced last year when Taylor said he was “putting a band together” to make his first solo work.\r\nSlipknot were due to host their inaugural ‘Knotfest at Sea’ event in August as well as a summer tour in support of their latest album, ‘We Are Not Your Kind’.

(2, 'Joel Schumacher – 1939-2020: the maverick director who made studio films with serious style', '\"I think I’m one of the luckiest people that ever lived\"', 'When Minnie Driver starred in The Phantom Of The Opera, she really, really hammed it up. Hearing someone else on set moaning about her performance, she went over to director Joel Schumacher and asked if she was being too over the top. “Oh honey,” he said, barely looking up from his monitor, “no one ever paid to see under the top.”\r\n\r\nFinding the “top” and going way over it became Schumacher’s trademark across almost 50 years in the business – directing everything from sci-fi, superheroes, political thrillers, war movies, courtroom dramas, musicals and comedies with big, colourful, witty style and a rare sense of humour. Some of his films flopped, some were forgotten altogether, others stood as solid studio flicks and a handful leapt out as modern cult classics, but all were unmistakably Joel Schumacher movies.\r\nJoel Schumacher came to prominence as a director later in life. Credit: Alamy\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nThe director died on June 22 after a year-long battle with cancer, leaving behind a legacy of 24 films, dozens of TV episodes and a fine crop of music videos – not to mention the hundreds of Hollywood careers that owe everything to him, now lining up to remind the world what a funny, sad, sweet and genuine talent he really was.\r\n\r\nSchumacher got his break in Hollywood as a costume designer (yep, the same guy who later put nipples on the Batsuit…), moving from dressing windows in New York to dressing Woody Allen on the set of Sleeper and Interiors. Costume work turned to script writing, and a few early directing duds turned into a bigger opportunity when he met The Brat Pack in 1985 for cool-kid coming-of-age drama St. Elmo’s Fire.\r\nSt Elmo\'s Fire\r\n‘St. Elmo’s Fire’ arrived in 1985. Credit: Alamy\r\n✕\r\n\r\nTwo years later, the runaway success of that film and most of its young stars led to The Lost Boys – a moody, sexy, vampire film that was shot with music-video flair and quickly became everything Twilight wanted to be 20 years later. The early ’90s brought another dozen changes in direction for Schumacher as he honed his craft on most of the best films of his career including rom coms (Cousins), grown-up sci-fi (Flatliners), angry social dramas (Falling Down) and taught courtroom dramas (The Client).\r\n\r\nBy 1995, he was big enough for Hollywood’s greatest responsibility – taking on a Batman movie. Tim Burton had already laid the groundwork with two hugely successful and highly stylised movies, so Schumacher’s decision to come in and flip the whole franchise on its head was one of the ballsiest moves in superhero history. Swapping Burton’s dark and moody palette for neon camp and a Seal soundtrack, Batman Forever walked Bruce Wayne closer to the comics than ever before – proving the biggest hit of Schumacher’s career.\r\nBatman Forever\r\nVal Kilmer and Chris O’Donnell starred in ‘Batman Forever’. Credit: Alamy\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nFair enough, then, that his sequel, Batman And Robin proved to be his biggest turkey – and the one film that he often gets wrongly remembered for. “We deserved it,” he later reflected. “But isn’t it wonderful to remember a time that America was once so innocent that all we had to worry about was the next Batman movie?”\r\n\r\nBrushing off the fallout, Schumacher continued into the ’00s with another crop of varied, interesting, original films – each one pushing him into new genres and different directions. Working with Nicolas Cage on seedy noir 8mm led him to a Vietnam war epic, Tigerland. Tight thriller Phone Booth was followed by Cate Blanchett’s journalist drama Veronica Guerin and then Driver’s “over the top” performance in gothic musical, The Phantom Of The Opera, which earned him three Oscar nominations. 2011’s claustrophobic crime caper Trespass was Schumacher’s last film, but it was far from his best work – proving for the last time that his career was so much more than whatever movie he happened to be making next.\r\nThe Lost Boys\r\nTeen vampire drama ‘The Lost Boys’ was one of Schumacher’s most acclaimed films. Credit: Alamy\r\n\r\nAs actors, directors, musicians and friends take to Twitter to tell their best Joel Schumacher stories, it seems like his legacy is going to be much more than his work anyway. An openly gay director who claimed to have slept with 20,000 men at a time when Hollywood was still half-afraid to step out of the closet, Schumacher lived his life as boldly as he made his films – and he did it all without ever becoming a tyrant on set.\r\n\r\nSeal remembers how he made the video for ‘Kiss From A Rose’ for free, just because he liked the song (“that pretty much defined my career” he says). Matthew McConaughey wrote about how grateful he was that Schumacher cast him in his first film (“Joel not only took a chance on me, he fought for me”), joining the likes of Demi Moore, Kiefer Sutherland and Colin Farrell who owe everything to him.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in 2017 at a retrospective of Batman And Robin, Schumacher reflected on his whole career. “I think I’m one of the luckiest people that ever lived,” he told the audience. “I got my dream. I got it so much bigger than even I could have dreamed it. You know, I’m just a kid whose parents died very young who was on his own and grew up behind a movie theatre before TV, and I wanted to tell those stories, and look what happened.”', '2020-06-02', '12', 'Paul Bradshaw', 1),

I know what depth of field is. I understand the rule of thirds. Kind of. But all you need is a cursory glance at my camera roll to see that… well, I’m terrible, frankly (and the fact I just referred you to my janky camera roll and not real photography software should’ve given me away, too).\r\n\r\nEven that brief period in 2006 when I was wafting around the place with a DSLR glued to my face – a shameful, walking embodiment of the phrase “all the gear, no idea” – I was appalling to the point of offense.

Credit: Vikki Blake\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise – and delight – when current-gen technology arrived with its 4K resolution and virtual reality headsets and transformed me into a photographic goddess courtesy of the humble screenshot button.\r\n\r\nI love games because they make me feel capable and strong when in reality, I’m useless and feeble. The list of virtual activities that I cannot do in real-life is predictable enough: sprinting; swimming; climbing; racing; puzzling; shooting. If you and I were pitted toe-to-toe on any of these IRL challenges, I suspect you would win, and I say that even though I have never met you. I reckon I could probably beat you in a bread-and-butter pudding bake-off – honestly, I’m outstanding – and I once downed a pint of Caffreys faster than anyone else in my packed Union bar, but beyond binge drinking and pudding-making, you probably have me beat.\r\n\r\nPhoto mode – or the screenshot button should a bespoke mode not be available – is one of the greatest things to come out of this generation of gaming. It might just be the greatest thing ever, although it’s difficult to deliver an assertion like that with next-gen on the horizon. But before we turn our backs on current-gen, shoving it aside like a regretful one-night-stand the morning after, let’s spend a little time honouring the eighth console generation’s greatest achievement.\r\nUncharted-The Lost Legacy\r\nUncharted: The Lost Legacy. Credit: Vikki Blake\r\n\r\nI may not know how aperture or white balance really works, but my god, video games make me feel like I’m great at in-game snapshots. Of course, I very rarely do any of the hard work – unless there’s a specific photo mode that lets me manipulate all aspects of the photograph, it’s mostly done via the screenshot button and there is literally no skill required for that; a designer has composited that shot just so, and I’m simply snapping it for prosperity – but my capture library is awash with striking backdrops and luscious locations and charismatic characters. But more than that, just like the shots on our phones – or the rare few that make it to frames or albums – they hold a host of evocative memories, too.\r\n\r\nSome games go even further, though. Those that do offer an in-game photo mode – God Of War, Assassin’s Creed Origins, Red Dead Redemption 2, Shadow Of The Tomb Raider, Death Stranding; I’d go on, but you get the point – enable you to control all aspects of the shot, with some enabling you to unhook the tether of the camera’s perspective and sweep around to any angle you want, able to tweak the composition of your shot right down to the granular detail. I’ll admit that I don’t always know what I’m doing but my god, do I have fun doing it.\r\n\r\nI currently have 12GBs worth on my PlayStation 4’s hard drive, 12GBs worth of memories that I regularly dip into, as important to me as the blurry snapshots of the nights out and the parties and the friends I’ve collected throughout my life. There is no particular genre or type of game that I’m more drawn to capping although, diverse, expansive playgrounds like the later Assassin’s Creed instalments are undeniably appealing. I’m not biased to a particular art style, either; whilst it’s likely true that hyperrealistic visuals are especially effective at snagging the eye, particularly when it comes to trying to engage your non-gaming pals, all games – big, small, AAA, indie, long, short, colourful, monochromatic – have the ability to captivate. Each one is beautiful. Each one is important. Each one I’ve played reminds me of a period in my life, be that good or not-so-good.\r\nAssassin\'s Creed Origins\r\nAssassin’s Creed Origins. Credit: Vikki Blake\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, whole projects dedicated to recording the astonishing worlds of video games. Other Places shares videos and screenshots of beautiful video game worlds. Some outlets regularly curate the greatest shots and display them in end-of-year roundups, such as this striking collection at Kotaku (my UrbEx itch is so tickled by The Division 2 ones). My lounge bookcase is stuffed with Art Of coffee books; heavy, well-thumbed tomes that showcase the breathtaking concept art – and in-game environments – of my favourite adventures. I will never tire of looking at them, not even when current-gen becomes last-gen, not even when ray tracing becomes the new normal. Backwards compatibility will help us savour these memories for longer than ever, sure, but flicking through my capture gallery freezes that moment – that emotion – in time forever.\r\n\r\nAs we bid farewell to this generation of gaming – so long, my PS4 Pro’s impossible-to-dust, slanted, triple-decker chonkiness; sayonara, my Xbox One X’s power button that’s so hyper-sensitive, my dog can turn it off with his freaking tail – and gallop towards the next, here’s hoping we don’t leave the humble photo mode behind.', '2020-03-03', '2', 'Vikki Blake', 3),

Millions of viewers say yes ( YouTube/Sailing La Vagabonde )\r\n\r\nThe first thing Elayna Carausu noticed about Riley Whitelum, as their eyes locked across the town square in the Greek island of Ios, was his distinctive moustache. When he told her that he had a boat, she assumed it was a pick-up line. She was wrong.\r\n\r\nDespite having no previous sailing experience, Riley had used his savings from years working on oil rigs to buy a barely-used 43ft Beneteau craft from three bickering Italians. Luckily he had taught himself a few things in the months before meeting Elayna, who was working for a travel company in Greece, but his journey was not without the occasional mishap. He recalls one night in Dubrovnik, Croatia, when the boat – already slowly taking on water from a hidden leak – was swamped by a wake from a fishing boat. Riley awoke to a cabin awash with water and frantically Googled: “My boat is sinking, what do I do?”\r\n\r\nGoogle responded, somewhat unhelpfully: “All boats are sinking. The main factor is, how fast. Don’t panic. Find the source of the leak.”\r\n\r\nSix years on, and things are now more plain sailing. The Beneteau has been upgraded to another boat, La Vagabonde, on which Riley, who no longer has to rely on Google, has been joined by Elayna and a stowaway – their 10-month-old son Lenny. And since beginning documenting their adventures at sea in late 2014, their YouTube channel, Sailing La Vagabonde, has amassed more than one million followers.\r\nWatch more\r\n\r\n    YouTuber with physical disabilities shares her secrets to happiness\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps unsurprising, the couple make for good TV; escapism without the queasy aftermath. They chronicle their life together aboard La Vagabonde in endearing, instructive and sometimes terrifying video, offering a view of life in authentically challenging circumstances; a contrast to the manufactured dramas that YouTube typically invites.\r\n\r\nAudiences have followed the pair across the Atlantic twice and the Pacific once; watching them brave storms, maggoty rubbish and broken equipment. We’ve seen the difficulties of life at sea, watching them deal with injuries and the boredom of spending weeks offshore when you’ve read all your books.\r\n\r\nMaybe what really compels is simply their competence and equanimity; there is no whinging on board La Vagabonde. Or maybe it’s the accents; both Riley and Elayna are Australian natives. Whatever it is, it’s working: a video posted at the end of May, Our Morning Routine Onboard, has had nearly three million views.\r\n[boat2-copy.png]\r\nOver time, the videos have become more polished (YouTube/Sailing La Vagabonde)\r\n\r\nWhen I meet Riley and Elayna, they are at home on their catamaran, having been forced to dock in Newport, in the US state of Rhode Island, while they wait for new parts for their broken engine. Luckily they were offered a spot at Gurney’s Newport Resort & Marina, when the dockmaster, Sean Kellershon – who has been following their adventures for years – saw them heading north after months in the Bahamas. “They just seemed like really cool people,” he says.\r\n\r\nAs we chat, Lenny gnaws on an apple and plays with a USB cord. He has barely any baby gear, and even fewer toys – a Jolly Jumper; a baby seat; a stick, a triangle and a pair of tiny cymbals. “To explain the obvious,” Riley says, “boat living is enforced minimalism.”\r\n\r\nRiley wears what looked like a Star Wars T-shirt, except that Mark Hamill’s face is replaced with his own, and Carrie Fisher’s with Elayna’s. Under Darth Vader’s helmet is Lenny. Designed by a fan, it’s La Vagabonde merchandise made by an ecologically conscious company in Los Angeles. The couple sell shirts, hoodies, totes, sailing guides and cookbooks they have written from their website, all mailed in compostable envelopes.\r\n\r\n    I had always hung around guys who didn’t have any goals, and here was this sailor guy who just got stuff done. I knew he was going to go far, and I wanted to be a part of that\r\n\r\nElayna\r\n\r\nBut most of their income comes from patrons – about 3,500 subscribers who pay between $3 and $10 (£2-£8) for early access to the videos, plus other perks, like the chance to meet the couple for dinner and a sail, perhaps, if La Vagabonde comes to their town.\r\n\r\nLiving costs aboard are moderate, with Elayna estimating that they might spend $400 (£310) on groceries every two weeks, to supplement the fish they catch themselves, and the same amount every two months or so on diesel fuel. They run their engine as little as possible and charge their batteries with solar and wind power.\r\n\r\nStill, boat maintenance is expensive. Conventional wisdom says that, once a boat is more than two years old, it costs 15 per cent of its purchase price every year. Their elegant and airy new boat, a 48-ft Outremer, is about two-and-a-half years old, and lists at over £600,000. Having seen one in Los Roques, an archipelago off Venezuela, Riley wooed the company, and a boat was specifically designed for the couple, and a lease arranged so they could pay monthly at a slightly discounted rate.\r\n\r\nOn forums like Reddit, fans debate the couple’s good fortune. Have they sold out? Are they still relatable? Could you learn the craft of sailing from their videos if they’re in such a high-end craft? But as one poster notes, “ People think that just anyone can get a GO PRO and do a YouTube Channel, get on Patreon and make hay. It just does not work this way.

Between three-week shifts, he backpacked around the world, intent on saving his money. At the start of a trip through South America, he broke his neck in the surf at Rio’s Copacabana beach. The surgery temporarily paralysed his vocal cords, and he couldn’t speak or work for six months.\r\n\r\nDespite having sailed only once, a miserable three days beating into the wind off Southern Australia, Riley says it was his dream to buy a boat and learn how to handle it. “OK, so you’re going to be alone forever, then,” a friend predicted darkly\r\n\r\nElayna, meanwhile – a tomboy with two older brothers, who learned to ride a motorcycle before she ever got on a bike – had learned to drive a motorboat during high school, where her curriculum included marine studies and aquaculture. She then worked as a divemaster in Queensland, living in a Kia van that she had painted and fixed up – until the fateful trip to Ios, where she met Riley.\r\n[boat1-copy.png]\r\nThe couple’s young son lives with them on the boat (YouTube/Sailing La Vagabonde)\r\n\r\nThe pair had known each other barely more than a month when he said, “It would be great if you’d sail the world with me.” Elayna did just that, selling all her belongs and leaving her job in Ios two weeks early. “I had always hung around guys who didn’t have any goals, and here was this sailor guy who just got stuff done,” she says. “I knew he was going to go far, and I wanted to be a part of that.”\r\n\r\n“What about the waves? What about the sharks?” Elayna remembers her mother asking. “Deep-ocean sailing, for her, was a combination of Jaws and The Perfect Storm.” It was one reason why Elayna began posting reassuring footage of their trip.\r\n\r\n    I thought people would be interested. I wanted to put our videos up on YouTube but Riley wouldn’t let me\r\n\r\nElayna\r\n\r\nThe first videos are very much like home movies, charting progress south from the Mediterranean to Cape Verde and then across the Atlantic. “I saw something good in what we were doing,” Elayna says, “and I thought people would be interested. I wanted to put our videos up on YouTube but Riley wouldn’t let me.” But by the time they reached Malta a month later, he had relented. Within a few weeks of its posting, their first video had reached over 70,000 views.\r\n\r\n“She was flipping out, and I was like, ‘Cool, but what does it mean?’ For five months, it was still a hobby,” Riley says.\r\n\r\nFunds were low after their first Atlantic crossing, and they were broke by the time they reached Grenada. As they prepared to fly home to work, having hauled the boat out of the water, they announced their plans in a video to let their community know that would be the last for a while. Subscribers turned into paying patrons by the hundreds. It took some time, however, for Riley to wrap his head around the idea of being crowdfunded. “That was really hard for me,” he says, “taking money from strangers.”\r\nRead more\r\n\r\n    The YouTube nonnas making pasta cool\r\n    YouTube comes under criticism for ‘demonetising queer content’\r\n    The man who gives an ASMR boyfriend experience on YouTube\r\n    YouTuber Trisha Paytas faces backlash after claiming she is trans\r\n\r\nThese days their videos are more polished, thanks to the use of a drone plus multiple cameras and editing help. The filming process typically takes three days, and since Lenny’s birth, Elayna has hired an editor to make the initial cuts, although she puts the finishing touches on before posting. They hope to keep sailing, boat-school Lenny and continue to make videos – Kardashian-like, but wholesome and afloat.\r\n\r\nElayna has also designed a swimwear line, Vaga Bella Swim, made from recycled, ocean-harvested plastic trash, and plans to donate the proceeds to a charity. “I’ve always been dreaming of the perfect bikini,” she says. “Something that looks a little bit sexy, but that you can spearfish and dive in without having a body part fall out.” The couple also hope to turn their boat into a vessel with zero or low emissions.\r\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\r\n\r\nThey are currently sailing to Charleston, South Carolina, where they will leave the boat with friends for two months so that they can return home for Christmas. They’ll then return to take the boat through the Panama Canal and across the Pacific to Australia, a first for them, and circumnavigate their home country, with all the challenges that will bring.\r\n\r\n“One year on a boat is like 10 on land,” Riley said. “Now, it’s as if we’ve been married for 50 years.

With that, a bevy of new vegan-only spots have opened too. Here’s a selection of the best old and new eateries for those eschewing animal products…', 'Life’n One\r\n\r\nThis wellness centre and yoga hub off Jumeirah Beach Road has a fully vegan café in its garden that is a must-visit while you’re in Dubai. It is a pioneer for plant-based cuisine in the country, having been around for five years, and has a laidback, Balinese vibe, with wooden tables and cushions on the floor, both inside and outside. The menu boasts some tasty sugar, gluten and additive-free food, from acai bowls to homemade cashew cheeses. In particular, the cashew tzatziki bowl, eggless omelette and Snickers Pie come highly recommended. There is also a great selection of superfood smoothies, immune-boosting hot drinks and refillable alkaline water available.\r\nVeganity\r\n\r\nThis is the new kid on the block and got people talking when it was announced earlier this year it would serve the world’s largest selection of vegan food. Whether or not Veganity has lived up to that promise is hard to verify, but its quirky, bright pink café in City Walk certainly does have a massive collection of great comforting classics. Burgers, shawarmas, pizza, pasta, waffles, chicken drumsticks – you name it, you can probably find it on the exhaustive menu. It’s already pretty popular, so you might have to wait for a table – but it’s worth it.\r\nFolia\r\n\r\nAlso brand-new is Folia, a concept from Saudi Arabia’s Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal and celebrated American chef Matthew Kenney, who founded Plant Food + Wine, plus 20 more restaurants across the world. The idea originated in 2018 in Los Angeles, where you can find the menu of raw and plant-based creations across various venues and catering services in the Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills. It arrived in Dubai on World Vegan Day, 1 November, 2019, with a dozen dishes at the Four Seasons Resort Dubai at Jumeirah Beach. They’re served across the resort and, while the weather is cool, on a dedicated fairy-lit terrace near the beach and pool. Dishes range from the super-healthy, such as an incredibly flavourful green gazpacho, to something more substantial, such as cauliflower tacos.\r\nSoul Sante Café\r\n\r\nThis little gem in Dubai Marina also opened earlier this year, with a focus on healthy but tasty plant-based cuisine. Soul Sante Café was started by self-confessed “fitness freak” and yoga practitioner Manisha Advani, who couldn’t find a dining spot in Dubai that served the kind of vegan food she loved. So she came up with this: a cosy neighbourhood-style café that serves up an eclectic array of food. Think banana protein pancakes and avo on toast for breakfast, pulled jackfruit tacos and beetroot sliders for mains, and peanut butter cup or lemon cookies for dessert. There’s a real effort to use all natural ingredients without any chemicals or additives.\r\nGypsy\r\n\r\nComfort food is what Gypsy is all about, and it does it very, very well. It has two branches – one in Dubai Marina and another new one in Galeries Lafayette at The Dubai Mall – that both serve impressive dishes cooked to order. This includes the recommended battered banana blossom “fish” and chips, southern fried jackfruit and doner kebab. Not to mention its famous vegan sausage roll. There are lighter options for those looking for something a bit healthier – one of the best being Grandma’s Cypriot lentil soup. It’s all home-style food made with love and passion.\r\nWild & The Moon\r\n\r\nThis Parisian export has been incredibly successful in Dubai, thanks to its unique take on health-boosting, plant-based cuisine. There are a number of branches across the country, but the most popular is at Alserkal Avenue, an industrial-looking arts hub that’s worth spending an afternoon looking around. The menu, which has been devised by nutritionists and naturopaths, aims to include as many locally and ethically sourced ingredients as possible, as well as gluten-free food options and organic cold-pressed juices, plus superfood smoothies. It also has a retail section, with items such as teas, T-shirts and tote bags. Hot tip: try the orange blossom pancakes.\r\n', '2020-06-21', '14', 'Jullie Hope', 4);

Yet with women contributing nearly 80% of the food supply, they only have access to 15% of the land.\r\n\r\nIn October, the African Union unveiled a statue dubbed \"Retiring the Hoe to the Museum’’, in the Burkina Faso town of Bobo Dioulasso to symbolically mark their agenda of promoting agriculture mechanization among women to improve food production.\r\n\r\nThe FAO estimates that only 15% of farm power is provided by mechanized services in the continent, 25% is provided by animals, with the bulk of the 60% provided by human muscles, out of which, 50% of that is provided by women through drudgery.\r\nIndependence through Vertical Farming\r\n\r\nOne innovative solution being discussed at the forum is Vertical Farming. It’s a method that uses no soil, 95% less water than traditional farming, and isn’t affected by the weather.\r\n\r\n“Vertical Farming does not need land. All it needs is space. If one woman or two can get space from the community they can build their own Vertical Farm, meaning that they can be independent thereafter for their families and for themselves,\" explains President of the African Association for Vertical Farming, Josephine Favre.\r\n\r\n\"If you are able to give an African woman that opportunity, to feed her family, then use whatever is surplus to make an enterprise, I think that is spot on.”\r\nFunding female entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nThe World Bank estimates that agribusiness in Sub-Saharan Africa will be worth 1 trillion US dollars (€904 billion) by the year 2030.\r\n\r\nMore than a quarter of women in Sub-Saharan Africa are already entrepreneurs - the highest rate globally.\r\n\r\nBut African women face a $20 billion dollar (€18.06 billion) financing gap, meaning they are hugely disadvantaged in growing their businesses.\r\n\r\nFormer London-based lawyer Grace Camara is harnessing the power of the African diaspora to combat this.\r\n\r\nShe set up the Remitfund, an investment fund where Africans sending money back home contribute a small percentage.\r\n\r\nThe money is then invested in entrepreneurs with social enterprise businesses in Africa from agriculture to tech and fashion.\r\n\"African fashion is like the cool thing now, a lot of it is featured on the catwalk so for me, this was really an opportunity to look at how we could support those fashion designers to bring their manufacturing base back to the continent,\" says Camara.\r\n\r\n\" With millions of followers on Instagram and selling to celebrities around the world, we could potentially create between 50 to 100 jobs. Our ethos is diaspora driven development and we’re here to help the diaspora make a difference on the continent.”\r\n\r\nNetworking and a strengthening of ties between women from different countries is a key element of the forum.\r\n\r\n“I think that if we really want to help African women, then it’s not just about going to Africa to help them, although that’s important. We need to aid them in making international connections, to meet people, exchange ideas and grow their network,” says President of the Crans Montana Forum, Jean-Paul Carteron.\r\nAs more African women are empowered economically the conclusion of the forum is clear.

So he’s not that far off from reaching the age that Bruce Wayne was when he met Terry McGinnis in Batman Beyond. Just like in the DCAU, it’s entirely plausible that Keaton’s Batman has turned to a high-tech Batsuit to compensate for his aging body, but there’s only so much technology can do. In other words, Keaton’s Bruce Wayne will have to retire from crimefighting soon, and that’s where Terry McGinnis can come into the picture.\r\n\r\nJust like in the original Flashpoint story, one can presume that The Flash movie will end with Barry Allen returning reality back to normal… well, most of it. There will be a few permanent changes, and since Michael Keaton’s in discussions to keep playing Bruce Wayne, clearly that iteration of the character would be sticking around. However, it wouldn’t be difficult at all to put Terry McGinnis on Bruce’s radar and have the young man take over as Batman. Thus, we get our live-action Batman Beyond movie.\r\n\r\nNow obviously a Batman Beyond movie would not be 100% faithful to the original animated series. For instance, the Gotham City that Bruce Wayne’s protected for all these years and is now Terry McGinnis’ responsibility to look after would either have that same Tim Burton aesthetic from Keaton’s original Batman movies or just look like a contemporary metropolis, as opposed to having a futurist, cyberpunk design. Nevertheless, with Terry having gained a sizable following from the Batman Beyond series and his numerous comic book appearances in the following years, naturally the next big hurdle for him to cross is appearing on the big screen, and Keaton’s involvement is the perfect opportunity to make that happen.\r\n\r\nWhy Is This A Big Deal For The DC Film Franchise?\r\n\r\nClearly we haven’t hit over saturation of live-action versions of Bruce Wayne yet. On TV, we’ve seen the character on Gotham, Titans and within the Arrowverse, and within the last half decade, Ben Affleck’s played Bruce in the DCEU and Dante Pereira-Olson played Bruce as a boy in Joker. Robert Pattinson will take over cape and cowl duties for Matt Reeves’ The Batman, and now we even have Michael Keaton reprising Batman to look forward to, assuming a deal is reached. But bringing in Terry McGinnis allows us to shine a different light on the Batman legacy that’s never been shown in a theatrical setting before.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust like how Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse introduced Miles Morales to the general public unfamiliar with comic book source material, a Batman Beyond movie can show how someone fights crime as Batman, but in a different way than what we’re used to seeing from Bruce Wayne. Terry’s not as deductive as Bruce and is more of a wisecracker out in the field, but he’s still a component crimefighter, and it would be great to see what kind of dynamic a cinematic version of the character would have with Michael Keaton’s Bruce, who would still be feeding Terry intel and advice from the Batcave.\r\n\r\nIt’s been made abundantly clear that The Batman is set in its own self-contained continuity, so don’t expect to see Robert Pattinson’s Batman crossing over with Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman or Jason Momoa’s Aquaman. So with a younger Bruce already in place to give moviegoers their fill of classic Batman action, using Michael Keaton as the DCEU’s new Bruce and having him train Terry McGinnis as his successor allows this corner of the DC multiverse to keep exploring the Batman mythos, but in a way that doesn’t feel repetitious from what Matt Reeves is doing.\r\n\r\nAs things stand now, The Flash is scheduled to race into the theaters on July 1, 2022, so keep checking back with CinemaBlend for more updates on its progress, and look through our DC movies guide to learn what else this corner of the superhero film genre are on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2020-06-02', '26', 'Adam Holmes', 1),

', ' But, everyone who comes to AGT watches to discover people with some extraordinary talents who would have possibly toiled in total obscurity without the show. This season has been no different, and already offered up some wonderful singers and dancers. It\'s no secret, though, that some of the people who hit the AGT stage have other...less common gifts. Tonight, one rapper showcased a talent so oddball that it surprised Vergara right off the judges stand and into the audience.\r\nSPONSORED\r\nCNA\r\nCOVID-19: Why saving our forests can help stop the next pandemic\r\nby CNA\r\n\r\nSee More\r\n\r\nRapper Chef Boy Bonez took to the stage after telling an inspirational story about how he discovered the joys of rapping as a young teen doing rap battles, going on to win several, but hasn\'t been able to make it to the next level in his career yet. Now, anyone who has watched America\'s Got Talent on a regular basis will know that a lovely story isn\'t a guarantee that a contestant will get up on stage and deliver a heartwarming performance, and such was the case with Chef Boy Bonez. He\'s plenty talented, just not in the way we were expecting. Take a look!\r\n\r\n\r\nWooooooo, boy! Alright, I might need a minute after watching that again...OK, let\'s just dive into what Chef Boy Bonez did. Couldn\'t you feel the audience getting restless while listening to way too much of his intro and too many of his \"Let\'s get it poppin\' right now!\" But, then Mr. Bonez headed down the stage so that he could more fully present himself to the judges panel, which included guest judge (and Sofia Vergara\'s former Modern Family co-star) Eric Stonestreet, and this was when we saw the true nature of his talent.\r\n\r\nSure, Sir Bonez was rapping his heart out, but he was also poppin\' those eyeballs right outta his head! And, he did it much to the dismay of many in the audience, Howie Mandel and (to a not entirely extreme extent in my opinion) Sofia Vergara.\r\n\r\nTo Vergara\'s credit, she was never fully on board with what Chef Boy Bonez, The First Of His Name was doing. As soon as she saw those eyeballs bulge out of their sockets, she was visibly horrified to the point where the poor dear appeared to almost fall out of her chair before quickly hitting her X and turning away from the scene of this hip hop offense.\r\n\r\nBonez The Elder soon went back up to the stage, and that\'s when Sofia Vergara, bless her heart, turned around, pointed at the X button in front of Mandel and yelled \"Push it!\" to try to get Chef Boy Bonez to stop the madness. Alas, her fellow judges were too shocked to do anything, so when he made another pass by their station, Vergara high tailed it for further reaches of the auditorium and fell right into the kind arms of some young women in the front row.\r\n\r\nI mean, can you really blame her? I, too, am weird about seeing people bulge their eyes out of their heads, and I\'ve never even had to watch it happen right in front of my face, so I\'d probably be joining Sofia Vergara in stumbling into the audience were I to be ambushed in such a manner by a performer.\r\n\r\nAs a side note? Popping your eyes out of your head is either called exophthalmos, proptosis or globe luxation, depending on the degree to which the eyeball is pushed forward, and I\'m going to guess that Chef Boy Bonez is capable of full-on globe luxation, because I\'m pretty sure I saw them floating in space above his face parts at several times. And, yes, I may have done too much research but I had to distract myself from my repeated use of words like \"bulging\" and \"popping\" somehow, so try not to be too hard on me, alright?\r\n\r\nIn the end, Chef Boy Bonez got the three yes votes he\'d need to go through to the next round, meaning that we\'ll be seeing the whole of his left and right eyeballs again at some point. So, great?\r\n\r\nAmerica\'s Got Talent airs every Tuesday on NBC at 8 p.m. EST.

It was a shocking development to say the least and one that the film’s directors didn’t take lightly.\r\n\r\nBad Boys for Life directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah recently opened up about the decision to kill off the Joe Pantoliano’s beloved character. While the development was sad for the pair, Fallah revealed that there was actually a somewhat humorous component to the day they shot Howard’s funeral:\r\n\r\n    We wanted to make that the most powerful scene in the movie so we put everything in it. We were shooting, also, the funeral scene and Joey Pants came by. We were surprised like, \'What you doing here?\' \'It\'s my funeral! Can you put me in the fourth movie, as a ghost or something maybe?\'\r\n\r\nIt must’ve been strange for the cast and crew to bury Pantoliano’s character while still seeing him on set. Despite these shenanigans, Adil El Arbi went on to stress to ComicBook.com that they were just as torn up about the death as fans were but still sought to give him the best possible send-off:\r\n\r\n    It was, to begin with for us, the same reaction. We read that script and thought, \'No! This cannot happen! This cannot happen!\' We were heartbroken already in the script. Then, we wanted to do it as heartbreaking as possible because it broke our hearts when we read the script. Joey Pants is one of the greatest actors ever, he\'s such a sweet guy and he\'s such a good guy, man. He\'s in such iconic movies. We\'re always asking him questions like, \'How was Memento? How\'s Chris Nolan? How was The Matrix?\'\r\n\r\nHaving appeared in all three films as Captain Conrad Howard, Joe Pantoliano was a mainstay within the franchise. Not only did his character serve as a source of comic relief, but he also acted as a mentor and father figure to Smith and Lawrence’s Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett. This was especially the case in Bad Boys for Life, which made it all the more tragic when he was killed by Lowrey’s newly discovered son.\r\n\r\nDespite his character exiting the franchise, Pantoliano enjoyed his time working on the movie, even going as far as to say it was better than working on the first two.

', 'Even if I\'m extrapolating out a bit and it isn’t “heightened” per se to play a superhero, Scarlett Johansson is now saying she has felt some pressure in Hollywood to “stay thin.”\r\n\r\nIn a candid new interview, Scarlett Johansson talked about the pressure she’s personally felt as a woman in Hollywood, comparing her own experiences to a scene from the popular movie All About Eve that has always stuck with her. She told Candis Magazine (via The Eagle) regarding weight and the pressures of Hollywood:\r\n\r\n    There has always been pressure on actors to stay thin. There\'s a scene in one of my favorite movies, All About Eve, where Bette Davis is circling around the room, horribly upset about something, and she picks up a chocolate ... puts it down ... picks it up again ... puts it down again ... finally, she gives in and eats it, but only after a huge struggle! So even back then, there was the pressure going on. And now, it\'s much worse.\r\n\r\nAll About Eve is the popular 1950 film where Bette Davis made famous the line “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy night.” While off the top of my head, I don’t remember the particular moment Scarlett Johansson is referencing, we do know that the average woman’s BMI in the ‘50s was 23.6 and now the average has changed to 29.6. During that time, however, the trend in celebrity bodies has gone from voluptuous like Marilyn Monroe (or Scarlett Johansson for that matter) to very thin, like Gigi Hadid or Angelina Jolie.\r\n\r\nThe pressures of staying thin have been explored in recent movies like Judy (in which a young Garland wasn\'t allowed to eat a cheeseburger) and comments from celebrities in the industry themselves, and while I hope women are comfortable with their bodies no matter the shape, it doesn’t really surprise me that Scarlett Johansson has these feelings either. Actors often have to gain or lose weight for roles – some like Christian Bale are specifically known for it. But it’s one thing if it’s a choice an actor makes for a role. I’d imagine it’s another thing to hear about weight when it has nothing to do with the work at hand.\r\n\r\nScarlett Johansson has always been one to speak her mind on various topics. This isn’t the first time she’s spoken out about her body either, as she was the subject of leaked nude photos some years back. It’s no secret that she works hard to play Black Widow in the MCU, but it sounds like she has recent for her body and understanding its limits, also telling the magazine she’s not willing to develop an eating disorder like some might in order to keep the weight off. She also noted:\r\n\r\n    There\'s a weight I like to maintain, which is slim but healthy. But there\'s a healthy way to keep to that weight and there\'s an unhealthy way. I don\'t have any comment on how other people choose to live their lives - but for me, I am far too paranoid about my own health to take the road of eating disorders. I\'d rather just stay in shape the natural way.\r\n\r\nNext up, she’ll be fit as a fiddle in the Black Widow solo movie, also opposite Florence Pugh and Stranger Things’ David Harbour. The movie was supposed to be out in May but has been delayed by the Hollywood shutdown and current world events.\r\n', '2020-06-10', '29', 'Jessica Rawden', 1),

', ' However, in the early years of Clarkson\'s career, the American Idol alum\'s image apparently was everything to the people in charge. The most critical factor of all for Clarkson was the notion she needed to lose weight. The \"Love So Soft\" singer recently opened up in an interview and said,\r\n\r\n    When I was really skinny, I wanted to kill myself. I was miserable, like inside and out, for four years of my life. But no one cared because aesthetically you make sense. It was a very dark time for me. I thought the only way out was quitting. I like wrecked my knees and my feet because all I would do is put in headphones and run. I was at the gym all the time.\r\n\r\nIt should give everyone pause when someone as incredible as Kelly Clarkson says people sold her on the idea that she \"aesthetically\" made more sense as a thin person. This revelation holds powerful implications for society\'s views on health, perfection, and weight. It speaks volumes that she felt pressured to strive for a physical perfection in a way that left her with emotional scars and mental anguish, not to mention bad knees.\r\n\r\nKelly Clarkson has grown up a lot since the days when she let record executives dictate her image right down to her weight. Today Clarkson has a knockout body of work that highlights her exceptional vocal prowess.

Jenner included an amusing caption to let everybody know the real story behind their reality TV holiday extravaganza. Take a look:\r\n\r\n    Oh no big deal...just Ice Skating with @nancyakerrigan in Calabasas in 95 degree heat for our Christmas Special!!!! #nancykerrigan pic.twitter.com/w4pWtd7EQQ\r\n    — Kris Jenner (@KrisJenner) October 16, 2017\r\n\r\nKris Jenner evidently appreciated how goofy it was that they were all outside in the California heat for a day on the ice. Poor Nancy Kerrigan must have been frightfully hot in the jeans and fluffy white turtleneck she wore. On the other hand, it appeared everyone else received the memo it would be a hot day. Kendall Jenner\'s fun asymmetrical dress gave her breathing room, while Kourtney Kardashian and Kris Jenner went with cocktail dresses and tights. Moreover, Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian went extra short with their outfits. While Kim Kardashian bared some midriff, Khloe Kardashian showed off up top.\r\n\r\nDid you notice the absence of shoes on Khloe Kardashian\'s feet? Many people in the comments for Kris Jenner\'s Twitter photo are wondering if the Revenge Body star opted not to wear the skates because she is expecting her first child with Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson. Reports say Kim Kardashian also has a child on the way; however, she could wear heels because she and Kanye West acquired the help of a surrogate this time around.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of allegedly pregnant KUWTK castmates, Kylie Jenner participated in the filming of the Christmas special. But People says Jenner dipped out of the picture with Nancy Kerrigan because the Life of Kylie celebrity wanted to take it extra easy now that she is about five months pregnant, though she has not confirmed it. In fact, it is possible Jenner chose not to join the family on the ice because she would have felt obligated to follow Khloe Kardashian\'s lead and go barefoot as a safety precaution, which might have been a giveaway Jenner is pregnant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, some people wonder if Kylie Jenner sat out the photo because her baby bump is beginning to show. Usually, when the family has big news, they conceal as much as possible until they can talk about it on KUWTK. Therefore, it would make sense for her to take the bench until the timing is right and the family can talk about it on TV.\r\nSPONSORED\r\nCNA\r\nCOVID-19: Why saving our forests can help stop the next pandemic\r\nby CNA\r\n\r\nSee More\r\n\r\nDespite Kylie Jenner\'s absence from the photo, it seems everybody had a fun time during the filming.

And lol yes we have to film it in October to air during the holidays!\r\n\r\nIt is funny to see pictures like this one and think about how TV shows film their episodes months in advance of their intended airdate.

After 18 years and 40 combined seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, former lead Rachel Lindsay is no longer our only person of color to lead their own season. ', ' Matt James, a 28-year-old community organization founder, entrepreneur, and real estate broker is now the new Bachelor for Season 25, which should still be coming our way in 2021.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, this monumental casting did not come about during the easiest of times for the franchise. And, many of us in Bachelor Nation are quite glad that Matt is getting to shoot his shot at first-time love in front of millions every Monday night. But, I, for one, really want to make sure that the producers don\'t bungle this season to the point where even those of us who\'ve been wanting to see a man of melanin in this position for many moons have a hard time sticking with his...journey. So, here for you now, I have a list of things I really need to see from Matt\'s season of The Bachelor (aside from an official photo of him in a nice suit, like most of the other Bachelors).\r\npeter weber and ladies cast the bachelor 2020 abc\r\nMake Sure The Women Cast For Matt James\' Season Are As Diverse As Possible\r\n\r\nI can give The Bachelor a teensy bit of props for upping the number of non-white women cast in most of the recent seasons, such as Peter Weber\'s recent (and still basically infuriating, nonetheless) season, which you can see above. So, there hasn\'t really been any doubt that Matt\'s time as Bachelor would see a diverse cast. But there\'s also no better time like the present to really pump those numbers up.\r\n\r\nMake Sure That Season 25 Is Fun As Hell\r\n\r\nTell the truth. Don\'t you think that The Bachelor has gotten stale in a lot of different ways? Anything that\'s been on the air for as many seasons as this show has would. After the near total fiascos of Peter and Colton Underwood, I think it\'s time to really switch this whole bitch up and make sure what we see is as intriguing, surprising, exciting and just plain fun as all hell!\r\n\r\nThey can do all the aerial shots of the lush locations (assuming we get those in Matt\'s season) that they want, but I do not want to see a single helicopter date on Season 25. Hell, I\'d be fine if we don\'t see another helicopter until Season 972, but that might just be me. I hope the women are a bit older than usual, but let\'s not pretend that can\'t mean that there will be some weirdos in the bunch who will start shit, cry a lot or do oddball stuff that they\'ll have to answer for later. In short, they need to bring us the drama so that Matt\'s time as Bachelor is as enticing to watch as before.\r\ntyler cameron the bachelorette 2019 abc\r\nFocus On Matt James In His Season\r\n\r\nI know this may seem like an odd request and you might be saying to yourself, \"Why, whomever would they focus on in Matt\'s season besides Matt?\" Well, you\'re looking at a picture of him, right above this section: Tyler Cameron. Ever since Tyler became a breakout star on Hannah Brown\'s season of The Bachelorette, his best buddy (and business partner...and roommate) Matt has also been on our collective radar. And, while it\'s great that these two seem to have a very genuine bromance going on, it cannot be exploited for Matt\'s time as Bachelor.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, because it wouldn\'t be fair or appropriate, that\'s why. This is Matt\'s time to shine, so if the show leans too heavily on the Tyler of it all, it would just remind folks how much we love him and how he wasn\'t The Bachelor instead of Peter (in my mind it was between Mike and Tyler, but, oh well...). Then we\'re thinking about whether or not he be could be the lead in 2022, and suddenly we\'re not thinking about our dude Matt anymore at all. I\'m not saying we can\'t hear from Tyler at all, but once should be the limit, and preferably toward the end of the season.\r\nmike johnson hannah brown the bachelorette 2019 abc\r\nDon\'t Try To Drive Home The Fact That Matt James Is Black\r\n\r\nThis is really where having additional people of color working behind the scenes will help. You might remember how, during Peter\'s season, they traveled to some Spanish-speaking countries and made sure to include several scenes where he spoke that lovely language. I suppose this was in an effort to show off the fact that Peter is part Cuban (on Barb\'s side, I believe), but the results were pretty cringe-worthy, because it was abundantly clear that Peter did not grow up speaking any significant amount of Spanish. Honestly, he sounded like he had just learned every phrase he used.\r\n\r\nWe don\'t want this happening with Matt James, do we? The producers are going to have to be able to balance the things they usually do with opening the doors to other cultures on the show and making sure that the leads (especially) are doing things that feature their interests. Just because Matt is black doesn\'t mean that The Bachelor needs to go film in Africa for eight weeks. But, the flip side of that is that his season should showcase aspects of his life connected to his heritage that Matt is already interested in. If the man doesn\'t like gumbo, don\'t send him on a date to a gumbo factory. Yeah, I know there aren\'t any gumbo factories, but I also know that you know exactly what I mean.\r\n\r\nReally, if the producers take the time to think about this, they should realize that Matt James\' time as The Bachelor should, as all seasons prior, be about him and what he needs to find love, not simply his race. We still want to see kissing, confrontations, confusion and goofy moments. Fans will still need sweeping shots of mountains and waterfalls, and crazy dates that real people would never go on in regular life. Someone (Maybe even Matt!) should absolutely end an episode wallowing in a puddle of their own tears. As long as they can deliver on this, Matt\'s season should be golden.\r\n\r\n', '2020-06-19', '37', 'Jenny Manoban', 1),

We may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via links.', 'Ever since Anthony Ramos first dropped the bars “the ten-dollar Founding Father” in the opening number of the Broadway phenomenon Hamilton, he\'s been strapped on a fast-moving train to fame alongside his cast-mates, such as Daveed Diggs, Leslie Odom Jr. and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Just within the past few years, Ramos has been part of A Star Is Born, Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Trolls World Tour.\r\nSPONSORED\r\nTrading Blvd\r\nGwen Stefani, 50, Takes off Makeup, You\'ll Never Be Able To Unsee It Again\r\nby Trading Blvd\r\n\r\nHow These Gorgeous Celebrities Look Without Makeup or Any Cosmetics Shocked Us To Our Core\r\nSee More\r\n\r\nHis recent voice role as King Trollex in DreamWorks’ feel-good musical was an especially big moment for the actor because he’s always wanted to be an animated movie character. When the moment came for Anthony Ramos to show off his voiceover chops for Trolls World Tour, a bit of a giant Kaiju was in his way. So naturally, he had to improvise. As Ramos told CinemaBlend:\r\n\r\n    The way it happened was I auditioned for the role. I remember they hit me up and said they want to see you for Trolls, like you just got to record yourself doing these lines and I didn’t have any recording equipment or anything. I was shooting Godzilla in Atlanta, so I just did it on my phone in the closet. I just went right up to the closet in the bedroom, took my phone out, opened the voice memo app and recorded the lines. And I didn’t hear back for months and I thought I didn’t get it.\r\n\r\nThe audition process isn’t as glamorous as one would imagine, huh? Not only did Anthony Ramos record his first lines as King Trollex in an Atlanta hotel room, all of his lines were done away from the rest of the cast too. For the actor to remove constraints of his immediate (closet) surroundings and embody the monarch of the Trolls’ EDM region of its world is pretty incredible.\r\nAnthony Ramos as King Trollex in Trolls World Tour\r\n\r\nAlong with being the voice of King Trollex in the movie, Anthony Ramos also recorded the song “One More Time” for the Trolls World Tour soundtrack that also includes the talents of Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, Anderson Paak, Mary J. Blige and SZA. The actor is also gearing up for the release of Hamilton on Disney+ Independence Day weekend, where subscribers can see the actor play John Laurens and Philip Hamilton with the original cast back in 2016.\r\n\r\nTrolls World Tour also had an unprecedented release when Universal made the film available to rent at home on its intended theatrical release in April instead of delaying its launch date. The family film became a success on VOD, scoring $100 million in its first three weeks, and the fact that parents admitted to renting it multiple times at their kids’ request may have helped. Trolls World Tour is now available to purchase on Digital, Blu-ray and DVD.\r\n\r\nAnthony Ramos will also star in the movie adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In The Heights next summer, and he’ll be working with DreamWorks as the lead for an upcoming animated project set in space called Distant, which also has The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’s Rachel Brosnahan attached.

(38, '5 Ways Black Mirror Is Better Than The Twilight Zone ', 'I love The Twilight Zone. So you know I must love Black Mirror, too. It’s pretty much the spiritual successor to The Twilight Zone, making for a modern approach to the Sci-fi anthology genre. And everybody knows that The Twilight Zone is the king of that medium. Nobody’s denying it. The Twilight Zone is classic, vintage television.', '\r\n\r\nThat said—and I know this is blasphemy—but in some ways, Black Mirror is actually better than The Twilight Zone. Now, I know Black Mirror doesn’t have the legacy that The Twilight Zone has (Black Mirror debuted in 2011), or even classic episodes like “To Serve Man” or “Time Enough at Last” (Black Mirror only has 22 episodes to The Twilight Zone’s 156). But it still does have a few one-ups over the classic show, which I’m about to detail now. Minor spoilers below for The Twilight Zone.\r\nMr Dingle, The Strong Episode\r\nBlack Mirror is More Consistent With its Tone and Messages\r\n\r\nLike I said up top, I love The Twilight Zone, but in its 156 episode, five season run, it was super inconsistent with its tone and messages. For every great, thought-provoking The Twilight Zone episode like “The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street” or “He’s Alive,” you’d get about five or six other silly episodes like “Mr. Dingle, the Strong,” where Burgess Meredith gets super powers from some funny-looking aliens, and “Black Leather Jackets,” where three aliens disguising themselves as greasers try to take over a small town. Granted, I love even the stupid episodes of The Twilight Zone, but it’s undeniable that there’s a lot of Sci-fi garbage mixed in with all the great stuff.\r\n\r\nInversely, Black Mirror, while not slamming home runs with every episode, still at least stays consistent with its cynical messages about technology and the future we’re heading toward. Its tone is also pretty pitch-black for almost all of its episodes, with just a little levity sprinkled in here or there. From “The National Anthem” to “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too” with Miley Cyrus, you know what you’re getting into when you watch a Black Mirror episode, and it usually isn’t pretty.\r\nA funny-looking alien in To Serve Man\r\nBlack Mirror Has No --Or at Least, Very Little-- Reliance on Twists\r\n\r\nBe honest. Many of the best episodes of The Twilight Zone rely on an M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist to make them special. For example, would “To Serve Man” be the beloved classic that it is if not for that twist at the end? Would “Time Enough at Last” really work if Burgess Meredith didn’t break his glasses? Even fantastic episodes like “The Midnight Sun” are spoiled by the need to have a twist ending, robbing some otherwise great episodes of their potency.\r\n\r\nBlack Mirror, on the other hand, doesn’t really rely on twists. Sure, you could argue that “Playtest” and “Men Against Fire” have twists at the end, but they don’t really need them to work as episodes. And the two major episodes that do have twists—“Shut up and Dance” and “White Christmas”—are actually made more effective by them since the twists deal with subverting viewer expectations in regards to characters. Some episodes of The Twilight Zone actually need twists just to work, but not so with Black Mirror. When Black Mirror uses twists, it uses them to make you feel even worse about what you just watched. Not to tickle you.\r\nDennis Hopper in He\'s Alive\r\nLonger Episodes Means More Content\r\n\r\nDid you know that The Twilight Zone actually has a few hour-long episodes? It’s true. In season 4, the series toyed with making longer episodes, and I can tell you since I’ve seen every episode, that most of the hour-long episodes are not very good. “Mute,” “Miniature” “The New Exhibit” and “He’s Alive” are the only real stand-out episodes in the 18-episode season. And one gets a sense that the writers overwrote the episodes and didn’t know what to do with all that extra time they had after writing half-hour long scripts for the three prior seasons.\r\n\r\nBlack Mirror, on the other hand, always had longer episodes (“The National Anthem” is 44 minutes long, while “Fifteen Million Merits” starring Daniel Kaluuya is 62), so content was never really an issue. And the pacing is so much better because of it. What’s interesting about The Twilight Zone is that some of the half-hour episodes seem super rushed, while the hour-long episodes feel way too long, so there was rarely ever a happy medium. But Black Mirror never had that problem. All of the episodes feel just right.\r\nThe Entire History Of You\r\nMore Near Future Episodes Means More Effective Episodes\r\n\r\nThe Twilight Zone is in many ways a commentary on the Atomic Age. That’s all fine and good, and it represents a great time capsule of feelings that existed back then. But some of the concepts that evolved from these ideas seem kind of silly today. I always like to think of the wackier sci-fi episodes like “The Invaders”, where a woman gets a visit from these little men that look like toys, when I start saying things like, “The Twilight Zone is the best show of all time.” Because it’s not true. The Twilight Zone was great, sure, but it’s not the best show ever. That episode has literally nothing to say about anything (it even has a lame twist at the end), and it’s just a result of the kind of stories that you would find in sci-fi magazines at the time. And there are a lot of Twilight Zone episodes like “The Invaders”. Way too many, actually.\r\n\r\nBut Black Mirror feels a lot more relevant and even prescient at times. While The Twilight Zone dealt with topics like nuclear war in somewhat vague terms, Black Mirror takes technology we currently have (like social media and web cameras) and envisions a future that seems like it could happen in a span of years or even a few months. That makes the episodes much more potent and alive than a great majority of episodes on The Twilight Zone.\r\nBandersnatch\r\nBandersnatch\r\n\r\nThis one’s unfair since The Twilight Zone didn’t have the capabilities back then to do interactive movies, but how great would it have been to actually “control” William Shatner in “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet”? Or to tell that little, telepathic boy in “It’s a Good Life” to go straight and directly to hell, and then watch the consequences of your actions?\r\n\r\nThe truth is, it seems like only a scattershot show like Black Mirror, (a three-episode season? Go ahead! A Choose-Your-Own Adventure episode? Why not?), has the capability to be truly surprising since it ostensibly has no boundaries, which is something that The Twilight Zone could never do with its strict, network TV limitations.\r\n\r\nIn the end, The Twilight Zone will most likely always be the more revered show. But Black Mirror, while relatively “new”, still has a few one ups over the classic series. But what are your thoughts? Do you also think that Black Mirror is somewhat superior to The Twilight Zone?

However, Fox states that she only pretended to work on Bay’s car and the audition occurred at a studio with other employees present.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I did ‘work’ (me pretending to know how to hold a wrench) on one of Michael’s Ferrarri’s during one of the audition scenes. It was at the Platinum Dunes studio parking lot, there were several crew members and employees present and I was at no point undressed or anything similar. So as far as this particular audition story I was not underaged at the time and I was not made to ‘wash or work on someone’s cars in a way that was extraneous from the material in the actual script. I hope whatever opinions are formed around these episodes will at least be seeded in the facts of the events.\r\n\r\nSince Megan Fox released her initial statement, Michael Bay has also taken to social media to share it. He also included a still from her Transformers audition and offered praise for the actress. You can check out his post below:\r\n\r\nSince Bad Boys II, Megan Fox and Michael Bay have collaborated – on some level – on four films.
